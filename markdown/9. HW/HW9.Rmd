# Question 1

## a) Exploring if any sticker bundle seems intuitively similar

### i) How many recommendations does each bundle have on the App?

Each stickers bundle has 6 recommendations.

### ii) Find a sticker bundle that is both on the app and in the dataset: recommend 5 other bundles from the dataset which may have similar usage patterns.

I choose the bundle "Odd Anatomy". Just by looking at the names of other bundles present in our dataset I would recommend "sphallowen", "frombierun", "Halloween2012StickerPack", "creepycute" and "NaiveLittleThings".

## b) Searching for similar bundles using geometric models of similarity

### i) Creating cosine similarity based recommendations for all bundles

At first, let's convert our dataset into a matrix:
```{r}
pic_data_m <- data.matrix(pic_data[-1])
```

Second, we can create a function that provides the top 5 recommendations for each stickers bundle using cosine similarity method:
```{r}
recommend <- function(data) {
  cos <- cosine(data)
  rec <- t(apply(cos, 1, function(x) names(sort(x, decreasing=TRUE))))
  top_5 <- rec[, 2:6]
  colnames(top_5) <- c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4rd", "5th")
  return(top_5)
  }

# Running the function on our dataset matrix
recommendations_cosine <- recommend(pic_data_m)
```

Now, let's check the top 5 recommendations for the OddAnatomy bundle according to cosine similarity:
```{r}
recommendations_cosine["OddAnatomy", ]
```
As we can see, the recommendations that I had given in the beginning of the assignment basing on my intuitions were totally wrong :D None of the stickers I had chosen is actually within the top 5 recommended for OddAnatomy. Instead, we see that the top 5 recommended bundles are (from 1st to 5th): alien, xoxo, between, KLL, BlingStickerPack.

### ii) Creating correlation based recommendations

Firstly, we shall mean-center (column wise) the values of the dataset matrix:
```{r}
data_means <- apply(pic_data_m, 2, mean)
data_means_m <- t(replicate(nrow(pic_data_m), data_means))
data_means_m_mc <- pic_data_m - data_means_m
```

Then, we run the previously built function to obtain new correlation based recommendations:
```{r}
recommendations_cor <- recommend(data_means_m_mc)
```

And when we check the top 5 recommendations for OddAnatomy according to this method:
```{r}
# Checking how the recommendations vary for the selected bundle (OddAnatomy):
recommendations_cor["OddAnatomy", ]
```

We can see that the top 5 recommendations for the OddAnatomy bundle are the same as those provided by the cosine similiarity method.

### iii) Creating adjusted-cosine based recommendations

Firstly, we shall mean-center the accounts (so now we proceed row wise) of our dataset matrix:
```{r}
data_means_row <- apply(pic_data_m, 1, mean)
data_means_m_row <- replicate(ncol(pic_data_m), data_means_row)
data_means_m_mc_row <- pic_data_m - data_means_m_row
```

Then, we run the previously built function to obtain new adjusted-cosine based top 5 recommendations:
```{r}
recommendations_adjust <- recommend(data_means_m_mc_row)
```

Finally, let's see what the top 5 recommendations for OddAnatomy are according to this method:
```{r}
recommendations_adjust["OddAnatomy", ]
```

We can see that the top 5 recommendations for OddAnatomy change when we use the adjusted-cosine similarity method. Now the top 5 recommended bundles are the following (from 1st to 5th): xoxo, alien, between, KLL, word.

## c) Are the three sets of recommendations different from your initial intuition? Why so?
Yes, in all the three methods the recommendations provided in relation to OddAnatomy bundle are totally different from what I had initially inferred. I was basing my intuitions exclusively on bundles names, but perhaps the bundles that I have thought of are not the best recommendations in relation to AddAnatomy, despite their names seem to be linked in some way. Moreover, I did not have any look at the data. The three geometric-based recommendation methods provide different results because users who use OddAnatomy bundles are often found using other bundles as well, which are not those that I expected. This leads to higher recommendation scores for those packages.

## d) What is the conceptual difference in cosine similarity, correlation and adjusted cosine?

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Correlation is a measure based on how much the given values deviate from their mean. The adjusted cosine approach subtracts the mean before computing the cosine formula.

# Question 2

## a) Creating a horizontal set of random points, with a narrow but flat distribution

### i) What raw slope of x and y would you expect?

I'd expect the raw slope to be about 0.

### ii) What is the correlation between x and y that you would expect?

I'd expect the correlation between x and y to be about 0.

```{r a, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scenario a)", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("plt_1.png")
```

## b) Creating a completely random set of points

### i) What raw slope of x and y would you expect?

I'd expect the raw slope to be again approximately 0.

### ii) What is the correlation between x and y that you would expect?

Similarly, I'd expect the correlation parameter to be close to 0.

```{r b, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scenario b)", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("plt_2.png")
```

## c) Creating a diagonal set of random points trending upwards at 45째

### i) What raw slope of x and y would you expect?

I'd expect the raw slope to be about 1, as the regression line should be trending upwards with an angle of 45째.

### ii) What is the correlation between x and y that you would expect?

I'd expect the correlation parameter to be quite high and close to 1. An increase in x-values brings a similar increase in y-values.

```{r c, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scenario c)", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("plt_3.png")
```

## d) Creating a diagonal set of random points trending downward at 45째

### i) What raw slope of x and y would you expect?

I'd expect the raw slope to be approximately -1, as the regression line would be trending downwards with an angle of 45째.

### ii) What is the correlation between x and y that you would expect?

I'd expect the correlation parameter to be strongly negative and close to 1. An increase in the x-values brings a similar decrease in y-values.

```{r d, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scenario d)", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("plt_4.png")
```

\newpage

## e) Creating a pattern that suggests a strong relation but has no correlation

I was able to create the following pattern, which resembles a parabolic function in some sense and leads to a 0 correlation:

```{r e, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scenario e)", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("plt_e.png")
```

## f) Creating a pattern that suggests no relation but has a perfect correlation

I was able to create the following pattern, which leads to a correlation close to 1.

```{r f, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scenario f)", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("plt_f.png")
```

\newpage

## g) The relation between correlation and simple regression

### i) Running the simulation and recording the points

I ran a simulation that records a positive relation. Here are the coordinates and the plot:
```{r, include=FALSE}
# pts <- write.csv(interactive_regression(), file="pts.csv", row.names = FALSE)
pts <- read.csv("pts.csv", header = TRUE)
```
```{r}
pts
```

```{r g, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Simulation displaying a positive relation", out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("pts.png")
```

\newpage

### ii) Estimating the regression intercept and slope
```{r}
summary(lm(pts$y ~ pts$x))
```
As we can see from the summary above, the intercept and slope coefficients are the same as those shown on the plot.

### iii) Estimating the correlation of x and y
```{r}
cor(pts$x, pts$y)
```
As we can see, the correlation coefficient is the same as the one shown on the plot of our simulation.

### iv) Standardizing x and y and re-estimating the regression slope

First, we can create a function for the purpose of standardizing:
```{r}
standardize <- function(data) {
  data.frame((data - mean(data))/sd(data))
}
```

Then, we run the function and standardize the x and y values:
```{r}
x_pts_std <- standardize(pts$x)
y_pts_std <- standardize(pts$y)

std <- cbind(x_pts_std, y_pts_std)
colnames(std) <- c("x_std", "y_std")
```

And finally we re-estimate the regression:
```{r}
summary(lm(std$y_std ~ std$x_std))
```

### v) What is the relationship between correlation and the standardized simple-regression estimates?

As we can confirm from the regression summary above, the correlation coefficient of the original x and y values is equal to the slope coefficient of the standardized x and y values.
This comes as a consequence of standardization; indeed, after we standardize, the standard deviations of the x and y values become both equal to 1. And according to the formula for calculating the slope coefficient estimated by least squares:

$$
\hat{\beta}=cor(Y_i, X_i)\cdot\frac{sd(Y_i)}{sd(X_i)}
$$
This would mean that we are multiplying the correlation coefficient by 1, which returns a slope coefficient equal to the correlation.
